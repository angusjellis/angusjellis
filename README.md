### 👋 Hi there, I'm Angus 


I'm interested in the systems and economics of large scale software engineering organisations, with a particular focus of mine being removing the blockers to doing great work, and am currently learning about the fundamentals of lower-level computer science, while also expanding my ability to think in systems.

Outside of work, I enjoy running, lifting weights, watching West Ham, and listening to heavy metal.
